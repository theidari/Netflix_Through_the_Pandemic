&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret that <a href="https://www.netflix.com/"> <b>Netflix, Inc.</b></a> is the champion in the online streaming revolution. Its streaming platform allows users to watch ad-free content anytime and anywhere over the Internet. Its content library includes television shows, documentaries, and feature films covering a wide range of genres and languages. As of now, Netflix has over 208m paid subscribers worldwide, 74m of whom are in the USA. Such unlimited access to digital content has given rise to a growing trend known as “binge-watching”; the consumption of multiple episodes of a show in one sitting. For instance, Nielson has reported that 361,000 Netflix subscribers have seen all nine episodes of Stranger Things season 2 in one sitting within 24 h of its release.

<b>Reason:</b></br>
During the pandemic, people turned to the online streaming platforms for their main sources of entertainment. Netflix was one of the online streaming giants that seemed to have profited from this trend as indicated by their soaring stock price.
